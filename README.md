Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:

```ini
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

# Email Configuration (For Google App Password)
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_google_app_password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your_email@gmail.com
```

### **How to Get a Google App Password**
Since Google no longer allows less secure apps, you need to generate an **App Password**:
1. Go to **[Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)**.
2. Scroll down to **"Signing in to Google"** and enable **2-Step Verification**.
3. After enabling, go to **"App Passwords"** and generate a new one.
4. Use the generated password in the `MAIL_PASSWORD` variable above.

### Run the Application
```sh
flask run
```
The app will be available at **`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`**.

## 📧 Email Verification Process
1. After signing up, the user receives a **verification email** with a unique activation link.
2. The user must click the **activation link** to verify their account.
3. If the user doesn’t verify within a certain period, they must request a **new verification email**.
4. Only verified users can log in.
